The theme of the competition was \"baroque.\" \r\n\r\nA powerful, vain and manipulative king, a king who subdues his subjects an condemns them to death. Such were the ideas behind this piece, and so I used original characters for it (which can also be found throughout this page).  This illustration was selected as the winner of the challenge. Since it concisely exemplified the theme of the month. ",

    "description": "\"The dance of the coyongos\" is a folk dance within the carnival celebrations of Barranquilla. A dance that refers to the birds that live near the rivers and bodies of water of the Colombian Atlantic.  \r\n\r\nThrough this dance, two stories are represented simultaneously. On the one hand, there is the colonization of Colombian territories, where the hunter represents the Spaniards, the birds the indigenous people who lived in these lands, and finally, a fish that represents the riches of nature. Likewise, this dance is a call to safeguard and protect the places where these birds live, which are in danger of extinction due to the loss of their habitat. This call has been passed from generation to generation by riverine and beach populations, bringing this iconic dance to the carnival every year. ",
