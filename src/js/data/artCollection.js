A dance that refers to the birds that live near the rivers and bodies of water of the Colombian Atlantic.  \r\n\r\nThrough this dance, two stories are represented simultaneously. On the one hand, there is the colonization of Colombian territories, where the hunter represents the Spaniards, the birds the indigenous people who lived in these lands, and finally, a fish that represents the riches of nature. Likewise, this dance is a call to safeguard and protect the places where these birds live, which are in danger of extinction due to the loss of their habitat. This call has been passed from generation to generation by riverine and beach populations, bringing this iconic dance to the carnival every year. ",

    "description": "This illustration was made for a contest organized by the very first book fair of Barranquilla, Libraq. The theme was \"concert of letters\". \r\nWith this theme in mind, my goal was to create something that emcompased books and music, utilizing surrealism and size differences to encapture the theme as good as possible. And since this contest was for Barranquilla's first ever book fair, i tried to use elements and characters of its carnival and flag. ",

    "description": "As a member of the ADA ( in english, the Association of Argentine cartoonists) we were given the opportunity to create an illustration where we would represent a book that influenced our development as artists. \r\n\r\nMy choice was \"The Myths of Cthulhu.\" Fascinated by the worlds, characters and mysteries of such stories born from the mind of H.p. Lovecraft, I wanted to represent the cosmic, psychic and sometimes divine aspect of his stories. Lovecraft's tales shaped and influenced my ideas as an artist, giving them a strange and cosmic touch.

This shield is a manifestation of those ideas that constantly spin in my head. While they don't mean much to others, transforming ideas into drawings or illustrations frees up space in your mind to make room for new ideas and sometimes, seeing the finished piece, gives birth to better and new things. \r\n\r\nThis shield is an example of this exercise.
