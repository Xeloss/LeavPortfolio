There was already news from Wuhan the previous year, but in Colombia the health emergency was not declared until March. So the celebrations went on without problems. \r\n\r\nFor the 2020 Barranquilla's carnival, the queen of that year was Isabela Chams, a charismatic woman who would dance all 4 days of festivities. Using her joy as inspiration (and a photo where she has a rainbow dress and behind her a mural full of marimondas) this illustration was born. ",

On the one hand, there is the colonization of Colombian territories, where the hunter represents the Spaniards, the birds the indigenous people who lived in these lands, and finally, a fish that represents the riches of nature. Likewise, this dance is a call to safeguard and protect the places where these birds live, which are in danger of extinction due to the loss of their habitat. This call has been passed from generation to generation by riverine and beach populations, bringing this iconic dance to the carnival every year. ",
